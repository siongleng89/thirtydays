    <string name="avty_landing_intro_content">
        "This is a weight loss program that incorporates HIIT exercise and nutrition diet. We will guide you day by day through the entire weight loss process and also show you how to eat to maximise fat loss.

        Our HIIT exercise is a form of simple high intensity interval training which speeds up your metabolic rate and boosts your metabolism for up to 24 hours. This means you\'ll be burning fat even after you\'ve finished the run and walk.

        On the other hand, our diet plan consists of lots of high fiber and protein food, which will let you eat without getting fat.

        No more going hungry just to lose weight!"
